# Contact

The preferred way of contacting me is to mail me at
[me@jaspervdj.be](mailto:me@jaspervdj.be) or
[jaspervdj@gmail.com](mailto:jaspervdj@gmail.com).  My twitter handle is
[`@jaspervdj`](https://twitter.com/jaspervdj).  You can also try to catch me on
IRC -- I occasionally lurk as `jaspervdj` in the `#haskell` channel on
[freenode].

[freenode]: http://freenode.net/

For less urgent matters, send a postcard to:

> Jasper Van der Jeugt  
> Hohlstrasse 30  
> 8004 ZÃ¼rich  
> Switzerland  

I like postcards.

## Donate

I used to have a bunch of donate buttons on websites of various side projects,
from back when I was a poor student.  Since I am no longer a poor student, I
have now removed these buttons and I am redirecting the links here.  Instead of
donating something to me, please consider donating to
[Project HOPE](http://www.projecthope.org/) instead.
